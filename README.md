# MainOperations
This program can preform various logical, mathematical calculations and can also preform operations on data (for now is only wordfiltering). Wordfiltering refers to filtering out useless computer expressions, formulas, codes so that one can only read related text. It is not based on machine learning but is using re library from python which allows words following certain rule so it is not perfect. Mathematical operations include calculator and logical operations include comparision of characters, numbers and strings.
